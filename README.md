I am a goal-driven and detail-oriented Computer Science major specializing in Cybersecurity, currently in my senior year at the University of Maryland, College Park. I'm CompTIA Security+ certified, with a strong foundation in threat management, network security, and risk mitigation. I actively take the initiative to expand my skill set through hands-on projects and continuous learning. Proficient in multiple programming languages, I thrive in problem-solving environments and enjoy tackling complex security challenges.

## Objective
My journey in computer science has led me to develop a strong passion for cybersecurity. I am eager to transition into cybersecurity as a Tier 1 Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst or Cyber Security Engineer, where I can apply my technical expertise in threat detection, network security, and vulnerability analysis. With a proactive mindset and a passion for continuous learning, I aim to contribute to a security team that values innovation, collaboration, and resilience in safeguarding digital assets.
